# Check in 2 notes:

Marker D - pads are better here?> or is whats written good

Solo section:
for tenor solo, want just bass and drums, then back to fuill band, better to sneak in or to jus have them come in?

honest thoughs on the switch to samba? i likeit but the transitions seem a little rough

Same for waltz section (that I really like)
