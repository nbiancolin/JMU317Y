# JMU317Y Final Project - How High The Moon
> Nicholas Biancolin


### Big Intro
- Swingin Intro on last 8 bars (think [Diane Schur - I Just Found Out About Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxOBIfwbyEc))
- Full Band Hit on & of 4 before pickup
- Saxes take pickup into A (or maybe tpt 2?)

### A1:
- Soloist (either saxes or tpt 2) solo with rhythm section backing
- Horn Shots (turn maybe?) on ii-V into B

### B1:
- Saxes have melody harmonized (trombone light hits and pads)
- turnaround

### A2:
- Saxes Keep the Melody (in Unison first, then harmonized)
- Brass phat shots

### B2:
- Brass take over melody, saxes play counter melody to build energy for the "How Still My Heart, How High The moon"
  - Saxes play pads, Brass plays unison,
- Line ends, 2 bar drum fill into:

### SOLOS:

- Band plays first 4 bars of ornithology (saxes for first 2 bars, then everyone for last 2) (twist ending line for big sendoff into solos) (something like [Switch in Time - Sammy Nestico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II_XvGVZP4Q) - sendoff into piano solo)
- Soloist: Piano solo 
  - Just Piano for rest of first A
  - B: Same Deal, just piano and rhythm section
  - A2: Trombone (+tnr) unison lines, 
  - B2: Some Hits and pads, bring energy up to go into:
