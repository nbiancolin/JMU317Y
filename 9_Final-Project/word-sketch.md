# JMU317Y Final Project - How High The Moon
> Nicholas Biancolin - Feb 11th, 2024


### Big Intro
- Swingin Intro on last 8 bars (think [Diane Schur - I Just Found Out About Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxOBIfwbyEc))
- Full Band Hit on & of 4 before pickup
- Saxes take pickup into A (or maybe tpt 2?)

### A1:
- tpt 2 solo with rhythm section backing for first 8 bvars
- Brass Shots (turn maybe?) on ii-V into B

### B1:
- Saxes have melody harmonized (trombone light hits and pads)
- back into A with brass shots

### A2:
- Saxes Keep the Melody (in Unison first, then harmonized)
- Brass phat shots

### B2:
- Brass take over melody (unison?), saxes play counter melody to build energy for the "How Still My Heart, How High The moon"
  - Saxes play pads, Brass plays unison, (similar to end of B1 but more)
- Line ends, 2 bar drum fill into:

### SOLOS:

- Band plays first 4 bars of ornithology (saxes for first 2 bars, then everyone for last 2) (twist ending line for big sendoff into solos) (something like [Switch in Time - Sammy Nestico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II_XvGVZP4Q) - sendoff into piano solo)
- Soloist: Piano solo 
  - Just Piano for rest of first A
  - B1: Same Deal, just piano and rhythm section
  - A2: Trombone (+tnr) unison lines, 
  - B2: Some Hits and pads, bring energy up to go into:

### SUPRISE SECTION
- Band goes into waltz for a little bit, then

### SOLOS (again)

Dominant figure sendoff (potentially modify to match intro once written?), modified to become sendoff into Solo 2: Tenor Sax 
- A1: Just Tenor and Rhythm
- B1: Just Tenor and Rhythm
- A2: ~~Trombone shots~~ ** Trombone Unis lines (better suits piano) **
- B2: Sax Unison lines, shots with whole brass now - segue into:

~~~ SKIPPED ANND MOVED
### BAND CHORUS
- Right into Band Chorus over A1 and B1 (composed line)
  - Full band plays here (5 part density with some potential overlap)
  - At end, saxes break off to play unison lines, brass plays shots around the line
  - End on a big fall for:
~~~

"And now for something completely different" - Monty Python

- Big fall into solo piano montuno over vamp (Probably Gma7 to D7 but not confirmed yet, likely influenced by what the intro becomes)
- Drums solo 4x over vamp (with piano playing montuno)
- After 4 times, Bass enters, drums go into Samba groove for one more time through the vamp for horn players to get ready

### BAND CHORUS

**Band has compiosed "shout chorus" out of drum solo to keep energy moving**

### Last A2:
- (skip A1 and B1 bc I feel like the form is too long, so just do last A2 and B2)
- Saxes take melody in unison
- Trumpets play duet melodies and hits as fills 

### Last B2
- Saxes & Bones Harmonized (only for first time)
- Trumpets still doing duet fills
- Tag Ending 3 times
  - On Tags, bones join trumpets for big brass hits
- After final tag, everyone cuts out, held D from D7 chord, ~~saxes unison play the final "How High the Moon"~~
  ~~- Everyone comes back in for a final unison ending line, ends on big hit~~
  - Back t swing for very last "how high the moon", quick light ending tying us back to the beginning
