# Soledad y el Mar Word Sketch

General Goal: Lots of Duet Trumpets (Mariachi Style)

Intro:
- Duet tpts on signature riff
- Modify segue into main

A1:
- Just vocals and Rhythm Section

A2:
- Horns come in with bolero comping and fills
  - Maybe some pyramids?

B1: 
- Soft pads (maybe even unison line in low horns)
- Somehow harmony, maybe singer unison with horns in chrorale/density
- Then open out to pads for end bit with held notes

A3:
- Mariachi tpt fills (duet)

B2:
- Horns in density/chorale form here (Singer in unison with top trumpet? or maybe rest)
- Held notes become segue into solos?

SOLOS:
- Backgrounds on queue
- Mix of pads and unison lines behind stuff (ideally piano or tpt solo)
- IDEA: Write in a Mariachi trumpet duet solo(i)?
- Out of solos goes into "Shout Chorus" with same density as before but up an octave (maybe different key for effect?)

"SHout Chours"
- Not sure if I want vocals or band chours here but something (over B section)
- Held notes same as always (longer hold)

C:
- 1x just rhythm, 2nd x pads, 3rd/4th x mariachi horns

Ending:
- Mariachi horn duet on last line / vocal line
- Big ending chord
